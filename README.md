# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Saksham Azad (@SakshamAzad9)
**ðŸš€ AI & ML Enthusiast | Researcher | Developer** 

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm **Saksham Azad**, an **AI & ML enthusiast** passionate about **chatbots, generative AI**, and **computer vision**. I love exploring new technologies and contributing to innovative projects. Below you'll find some details about my ongoing work, my skills, and how you can get in touch.

## ðŸš€ Current Projects on Run & Interests

### **ðŸ”¹ ROMIO - AI-Powered Travel Assistant**
I'm currently working on **ROMIO**, an AI-based travel chatbot that provides **decentralized travel data** to help users explore new places in a more personalized way. The chatbot generates AI-powered itineraries, recommends food spots, rest areas, and shopping locations beyond conventional tools like Google Maps. It also features community-driven recommendations, route optimization, and more.
âœ… AI-generated itineraries
âœ… Community-driven recommendations (Reddit + Instagram-style)
âœ… Real-time travel navigation & smart search
âœ… Route optimization & one-ticket travel solutions (Future scope: Travel Buddy, Explorer Profiles, Local Business Portfolios, Radial Ads, and more!)

## ðŸš€ Projects & Interests
